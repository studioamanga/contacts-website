    <ul>
      <li>All contacts data comes from the Apple Address Book API provided by the system, and is saved directly to the Apple Address Book API. Only the list of favorites (identifiers only, not the contacts details) is stored by the app.</li>
      <li>No third-party software has access to your data.</li>
      <li>Your contacts data remains in the Apple Address Book API container when you delete the app from your device. The list of favorites is deleted when you delete the app.</li>
